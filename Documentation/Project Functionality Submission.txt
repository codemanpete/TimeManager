Dr. Zhang,

We have come up with some more functionality for our submission to further increase complexity and create more use cases. Here is the reformed project we would like to submit:

Task Scheduler/Calendar application. The primary function for this application is to allow users to manage time more effectively by scheduling meetings and other tasks with other users. This also includes assigning locations and objects to tasks and the ability to check other users calendars as well.


The features this application would have would include, but not be limited to:
1. Multiple User Support (with some sort of Login)
2. Add/Delete/Edit User information
3. Add/Edit/Remove Scheduled Task Information (Start date, End Date, Notes)
4. Ability to lookup other system users
5. Ability to see if other users are busy
6. Ability to schedule meetings with other users
7. Ability to add group assets to appointments (conference rooms, offices, projectors, etc)
8. Program alerts users 10/15/20/30 minutes before appointment
9. Scheduled Task information stored in local or shared database (flat file or SQL
database)
10. Adding users to teams/groups to schedule team meetings
11. Contact list
12. Daily/Weekly/Monthly Views
13. Dynamic scheduling (ability to move lower and higher priority appointments) 
14. Public and Private scheduled events.

We have added one more to our group, which now consists of Peter Cheng, Brendan Walker, Charles McEniry, and myself. 

As always, we welcome feedback and input.
